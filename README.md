# My First Website with Flask

This repository contains the source code for my first website using the Flask framework. I created this site to practice and understand how HTTP requests work and how the Flask framework operates.

## Description

This project is a simple website demonstrating basic Flask capabilities:
- Creating routes to handle different HTTP requests.
- Processing forms and data submitted by users.

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to gain practical experience with Flask and understand the principles of web servers and HTTP requests.
